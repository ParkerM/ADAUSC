This app, meant for use on Android platforms, entitled ADA Standards, will be designed for storing and displaying
architectural standards set in place by the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA). These
standards include specifications for handicap-accessible construction of dorms, social
service centers, medical care facilities, etc. These specifications include door widths and 
ramp angles and lengths, for example. "ADA Standards" should make it easy and efficient
to access these standards when in the field or when a stationary and/or written source is
not available.
