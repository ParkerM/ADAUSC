ADA Access, sponsored by [AbleSC](http://www.able-sc.org/), will be designed for storing and displaying architectural standards set in place by the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA). These standards include specifications for accessible construction of dorms, social service centers, medical care facilities, etc. These specifications include door widths and ramp angles and lengths, for example. ADA Access should be an easy and efficient way to access these standards when in the field or when a stationary and/or written source is not available.
