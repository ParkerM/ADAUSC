For example, if this document requires &quot;1 inches,&quot; avoid        specifying &quot;1 inches plus or minus X inches.&quot;</p>    <p> Where the requirement states a specified        range, such as in Section 609.4 where grab bars must be installed        between 33 inches and 36 inches above the floor, the range provides an        adequate tolerance and therefore no tolerance outside of the range at        either end point is permitted.</p>    <p> Where a requirement is a minimum or a        maximum dimension that does not have two specific minimum and maximum        end points, tolerances may apply. Where an element is to be installed        at the minimum or maximum permitted dimension, such as &quot;15 inches        minimum&quot; or &quot;5 pounds maximum&quot;, it would not be good practice to        specify &quot;5 pounds (plus X pounds) or 15 inches (minus X inches).&quot;        Rather, it would be good practice to specify a dimension less than the        required maximum (or more than the required minimum) by the amount of        the expected field or manufacturing tolerance and not to state any        tolerance in conjunction with the specified dimension.</p>    <p> Specifying dimensions in design in the        manner described above will better ensure that facilities and elements        accomplish the level of accessibility intended by these requirements.        It will also more often produce an end result of strict and literal        compliance with the stated requirements and eliminate enforcement        difficulties and issues that might otherwise arise.

The        majority of the requirements apply to the operational machinery not        seen or used by elevator passengers. ASME A17.1 requires a two-way        means of emergency communications in passenger elevators. This means of        communication must connect with emergency or authorized personnel and        not an automated answering system. The communication system must be        push button activated. The activation button must be permanently        identified with the word &quot;HELP.&quot; A visual indication acknowledging the        establishment of a communications link to authorized personnel must be        provided. The visual indication must remain on until the call is        terminated by authorized personnel. The building location, the elevator        car number, and the need for assistance must be provided to authorized        personnel answering the emergency call. The use of a handset by the        communications system is prohibited. Only the authorized personnel        answering the call can terminate the call. Operating instructions for        the communications system must be provided in the elevator car.</p>    <p>The provisions for escalators require that        at least two flat steps be provided at the entrance and exit of every        escalator and that steps on escalators be demarcated by yellow lines 2        inches wide maximum along the back and sides of steps.</p>    <p> ASME A18.1-1999 and ASME A18.1-2003 address        the design, construction, installation, operation, inspection, testing,        maintenance and repair of lifts that are intended for transportation of        persons with disabilities. Lifts are classified as: vertical platform        lifts, inclined platform lifts, inclined stairway chairlifts, private        residence vertical platform lifts, private residence inclined platform        lifts, and private residence inclined stairway chairlifts.</p>    <p> This document does not permit the use of        inclined stairway chairlifts which do not provide platforms because        such lifts require the user to transfer to a seat. </p>    <p> ASME A18.1 contains requirements for        runways, which are the spaces in which platforms or seats move. The        standard includes additional provisions for runway enclosures,        electrical equipment and wiring, structural support, headroom clearance        (which is 80 inches minimum), lower level access ramps and pits. The        enclosure walls not used for entry or exit are required to have a grab        bar the full length of the wall on platform lifts. Access ramps are        required to meet requirements similar to those for ramps in Chapter 4        of this document.</p>    <p> Each of the lift types addressed in ASME        A18.1 must meet requirements for capacity, load, speed, travel,        operating devices, and control equipment.

These        standards are referenced in the play areas requirements of this        document when an accessible surface is required inside a play area use        zone where a fall attenuating surface is also required. The standards        cover the minimum impact attenuation requirements, when tested in        accordance with Test Method F 355, for surface systems to be used under        and around any piece of playground equipment from which a person may        fall.</p>    <p> ASTM F 1487-01 establishes a nationally        recognized safety standard for public playground equipment to address        injuries identified by the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission.

The play areas requirements in this document        reference the ASTM F 1487 standard when defining accessible routes that        overlap use zones requiring fall attenuating surfaces. If the use zone        of a playground is not entirely surfaced with an accessible material,        at least one accessible route within the use zone must be provided from        the perimeter to all accessible play structures or components within        the playground.</p>    <p> ASTM F 1951-99 establishes a uniform means        to measure the characteristics of surface systems in order to provide        performance specifications to select materials for use as an accessible        surface under and around playground equipment. Surface materials that        comply with this standard and are located in the use zone must also        comply with ASTM F 1292. The test methods in this standard address        access for children and adults who may traverse the surfacing to aid        children who are playing. When a surface is tested it must have an        average work per foot value for straight propulsion and for turning        less than the average work per foot values for straight propulsion and        for turning, respectively, on a hard, smooth surface with a grade of 7%        (1:14).</p></div class="advisory"><blockquote>    <p> <strong>105.2.4 ICC/IBC.</strong> Copies of the referenced standard may be obtained from the        International Code Council, 5203 Leesburg Pike, Suite 600, Falls        Church, Virginia 22041 (www.iccsafe.org).</p>    <blockquote>        <p> International Building Code, 2000 Edition (see 207.1, 207.2, 216.4.2, 216.4.3, and 1005.2.1).</p>        <p> International Building Code, 2001 Supplement (see 207.1 and 207.2).</p>        <p> International Building Code, 2003 Edition (see 207.1, 207.2, 216.4.2, 216.4.3, and 1005.2.1). </p>    </blockquote></blockquote><div class="advisory" >    <p> <strong>Advisory 105.2.4 ICC/IBC.</strong> International        Building Code (IBC)-2000 (including 2001 Supplement to the        International Codes) and IBC-2003 are referenced for means of egress,        areas of refuge, and railings provided on fishing piers and platforms.        At least one accessible means of egress is required for every        accessible space and at least two accessible means of egress are        required where more than one means of egress is required.

In        particular, NFPA 72 requires visible alarms to have a light source that        is clear or white and has polar dispersion complying with UL 1971.</p></div class="advisory"><h5><a name="106" id="106"></a>106 Definitions</h5><p> <strong>106.1 General.</strong> For the purpose of this document, the terms defined in 106.5 have the indicated meaning. </p><div class="advisory">    <p> <strong>Advisory 106.1 General.</strong> Terms defined in Section 106.5 are italicized in the text of this document.</p></div class="advisory"><p><strong>106.2 Terms    Defined in Referenced Standards.</strong> Terms not defined in 106.5 or in    regulations issued by the Department of Justice and the Department of    Transportation to implement the Americans with Disabilities Act, but    specifically defined in a referenced standard, shall have the specified    meaning from the referenced standard unless otherwise stated.</p><p> <strong>106.3 Undefined Terms</strong>.

There are exceptions for alterations to qualified historic        buildings and facilities for accessible routes (206.2.1 Exception 1 and        206.2.3 Exception 7); entrances (206.4 Exception 2); and toilet        facilities (213.2 Exception 2). When an entity believes that compliance        with the requirements for any of these elements would threaten or        destroy the historic significance of the building or facility, the        entity should consult with the State Historic Preservation Officer. If        the State Historic Preservation Officer agrees that compliance with the        requirements for a specific element would threaten or destroy the        historic significance of the building or facility, use of the exception        is permitted. Public entities have an additional obligation to achieve        program accessibility under the Department of Justice ADA regulations.        See 28 CFR 35.150. These regulations require public entities that        operate historic preservation programs to give priority to methods that        provide physical access to individuals with disabilities. If        alterations to a qualified historic building or facility to achieve        program accessibility would threaten or destroy the historic        significance of the building or facility, fundamentally alter the        program, or result in undue financial or administrative burdens, the        Department of Justice ADA regulations allow alternative methods to be        used to achieve program accessibility. In the case of historic        preservation programs, such as an historic house museum, alternative        methods include using audio-visual materials to depict portions of the        house that cannot otherwise be made accessible. In the case of other        qualified historic properties, such as an historic government office        building, alternative methods include relocating programs and services        to accessible locations. The Department of Justice ADA regulations also        allow public entities to use alternative methods when altering        qualified historic buildings or facilities in the rare situations where        the State Historic Preservation Officer determines that it is not        feasible to provide physical access using the exceptions permitted in        Section 202.5 without threatening or destroying the historic        significance of the building or facility.

For example, in a physician's office, if people        without disabilities must traverse the full length of the office suite        in clothing other than their street clothes, it is acceptable for        people with disabilities to be asked to do the same.</p></div class="advisory"><p><strong> 222.2 Coat Hooks and Shelves.</strong> Where coat hooks or shelves are provided in dressing, fitting or locker    rooms without individual compartments, at least one of each type shall    comply with 803.5.

There are hard-wired systems        and three types of wireless systems: induction loop, infrared, and FM        radio transmission. Each has different advantages and disadvantages        that can help determine which system is best for a given application.        For example, an FM system may be better than an infrared system in some        open-air assemblies since infrared signals are less effective in        sunlight. On the other hand, an infrared system is typically a better        choice than an FM system where confidential transmission is important        because it will be contained within a given space.</p>    <p> The technical standards for assistive        listening systems describe minimum performance levels for volume,        interference, and distortion. Sound pressure levels (SPL), expressed in        decibels, measure output sound volume. Signal-to-noise ratio (SNR or        S/N), also expressed in decibels, represents the relationship between        the loudness of a desired sound (the signal) and the background noise        in a space or piece of equipment. The higher the SNR, the more        intelligible the signal. The peak clipping level limits the distortion        in signal output produced when high-volume sound waves are manipulated        to serve assistive listening devices.</p>    <p> Selecting or specifying an effective        assistive listening system for a large or complex venue requires        assistance from a professional sound engineer.

There are a variety of transfer        devices available that could be adapted to provide access onto an        amusement ride. Examples of devices that may provide for transfers        include, but are not limited to, transfer systems, lifts, mechanized        seats, and custom designed systems. Operators and designers have        flexibility in developing designs that will facilitate individuals to        transfer onto amusement rides. These systems or devices should be        designed to be reliable and sturdy.</p>    <p> Designs that limit the number of transfers        required from a wheelchair or mobility device to the ride seat are        encouraged. When using a transfer device to access an amusement ride,        the least number of transfers and the shortest distance is most usable.        Where possible, designers are encouraged to locate the transfer device        seat no higher than 17 to 19 inches (430 to 485 mm) above the load and        unload surface. Where greater distances are required for transfers,        providing gripping surfaces, seat padding, and avoiding sharp objects        in the path of transfer will facilitate the transfer. Where a series of        transfers are required to reach the amusement ride seat, each vertical        transfer should not exceed 8 inches (205 mm). </p></div class="advisory"><blockquote>    <p> <strong>1002.6.1 Clear        Floor or Ground Space. </strong>A clear floor or ground space complying with 305        shall be provided in the load and unload area adjacent to the transfer        device.</p>    <p> <strong>1002.6.2 Transfer Height. </strong>The height of        transfer device seats shall be 14 inches (355 mm) minimum and 24 inches        (610 mm) maximum measured from the load and unload surface.</p>    <p> <strong>1002.6.3 Wheelchair Storage Space. </strong>Wheelchair storage spaces complying with 305 shall be provided in or        adjacent to unload areas for each required transfer device and shall        not overlap any required means of egress or accessible route.</p></blockquote><h5> 1003 Recreational <a name="Boating" id="Boating">Boating</a> Facilities</h5><p> <strong>1003.1 General.</strong> Recreational boating facilities shall comply with 1003.</p><p> <strong>1003.2 Accessible Routes. </strong>Accessible routes    serving recreational boating facilities, including gangways and    floating piers, shall comply with Chapter 4 except as modified by the    exceptions in 1003.2.</p><blockquote>    <p> <strong>1003.2.1 Boat Slips.</strong> Accessible routes serving boat slips shall be permitted to use the exceptions in 1003.2.1.</p>    <div class="exception">        <p><strong>EXCEPTIONS: </strong>          </p>        <p><strong>1. </strong>Where an existing gangway or            series of gangways is replaced or altered, an increase in the length of            the gangway shall not be required to comply with 1003.2 unless required            by 202.4.</p>        <p> <strong>2. </strong>Gangways shall not be required to comply with the maximum rise specified in 405.6.</p>        <p> <strong>3. </strong>Where the total length of a gangway or            series of gangways serving as part of a required accessible route is 80            feet (24 m) minimum, gangways shall not be required to comply with            405.2.</p>        <p> <strong>4. </strong>Where facilities contain fewer than 25            boat slips and the total length of the gangway or series of gangways            serving as part of a required accessible route is 30 feet (9145 mm)            minimum, gangways shall not be required to comply with 405.2.</p>        <p> <strong>5. </strong>Where gangways connect to transition plates, landings specified by 405.7 shall not be required.</p>        <p> <strong>6. </strong>Where gangways and transition plates connect and are required to have handrails,            handrail extensions shall not be required.
