    <string name="app_info">       ADA Mobile, meant for use on Android platforms and created under
        the MIT License, is designed for storing and displaying architectural standards set in place
        by the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) most recently updated in 2010. These standards
        include specifications for handicap-accessible construction of dorms, social service centers,
        medical care facilities, etc. These specifications include door widths and ramp angles and
        lengths, among many more specific measurements and requirements. ADA Mobile makes it easy and
        efficient to access these standards when in the field or when a stationary and/or written
        source is not available.</string>
